I scream at the top of my lungs
But my voice couldn't save this home
You're proud of the guns you hold
What's left now? Where do we go?
I had a dream that the world changed
And for a minute there was no pain
Instead of presidents and old sayings
Then I wake up to see the world's ill
Ocean's tainted from the oil spills
How many kids have these wars killed?
How many familys can afford deals?
I wish I could let the world know
That it's okay to let the pain show
And even though times seem bad
It always rains before the rainbow
We all need a little more love
(I think we all)
We all need a little more love
(We just need)
A little more love
(The world needs)
A little more love
